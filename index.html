                        criminal offences and the drug trade. We focus on three key areas, the first being, how <b><span style="color: #984ea3;">Australia</span></b>
                         stacks up against the <b><span style="color: #118a41;">Rest of the World</span></b>. Are we a safe or dangerous country?

                    <p> There is also a deep dive on the emergence of cyber-crime and how prevalent it is becoming in modern society for us 
                        <b><span style="color: #984ea3;">Australians</span></b>. Finally, we nail in on the <b><span style="color: #8a7515;">drug trade</span></b>
                         an undoubtedly debilitating state that is affecting our <b><span style="color: #984ea3;">Australian</span></b> culture, and an 
                         issue that needs to be tackled so as to not continue its upward trajectory.

                            The biggest movers over the last two years have been <b>Maldova</b> and <b>Cambodia</b>, as both countries saw a large uptick in criminal activity.
