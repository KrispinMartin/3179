                        <p> Crime on all Levels is a data visualisation project that aims to provide a comprehensive overview of crime statistics in Australia. 
                            The project is divided into four sections, each of which focuses on a different aspect of crime in Australia. The first section 
                            provides an overview of crime statistics in Australia, including the number of crimes committed in each state and territory, the 
                            types of crimes committed, and the age 
                        </p>

                    <div class="discussion">
                        <p> of the offenders. The second section focuses on the relationship between crime and social factors such as unemployment, 
                            education, and income. The third section looks at the impact of crime on the criminal justice system, including the number of 
                            prisoners in Australia and the cost of incarcerating them. The final section examines the effectiveness of crime prevention 
                            strategies in Australia, including the number of police officers per capita and the crime clearance rate.

                            The Criminality Index is an “assessment of overall organised crime levels in a country.” It is made up of two main components, 
                            each of which has several subfactors:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Criminal Actors</strong> – The structure and influence of different types of criminal organisations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Criminal Markets</strong> – Consists of all stages of illicit trade of both commodities or people.</li>
                        </ul>

                            the safest of all, whilst Australia performs quite well with a score of 4.00 in 2023.

                            <p> The flip side of the criminality index is the resilience scores. Others combined with the factors below measure a country's ability 
                                to withstand and disrupt organised criminal activities via its own socio-political landscape. Australia in that regard has a very 
                                formidable social structure in place with a 2023 score of 7.38 ranking 19th of 193 countries. There exists a clear linear 
                                relationship between the criminality index and the resilience index. By far and away Myanmar is one of the unsafest countries in 
                                the world, ranking 1st in Criminality and 3rd last in resilience.

                            were the cyber attacks on Latitude Finance, Optus and Medibank which exposed personal data from a combined 34 million customers. We
